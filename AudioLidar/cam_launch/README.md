Two versions of cam_launch

cam_launch interfaces well with arena with switched coordinates, is the older version that does not have apriltag support

cam_launch2 contains AprilTag support as well as more advanced tracking algorithms, likely still needs to be refined a to deal with people dropping out of frame
